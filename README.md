bash-utils
==========

Some utilities I wrote to help my self.  

Some are written on a mac, therefore you will need a BSD or sth like that, otherwise it will fail, I guess.


There is no warranty on all those scripts, so take care.

I wrote them for myself, but I try to make them as generic as possible, so you may use them too. But you may replace some values so it may fit to yourself. I always add a 'help' or 'usage' text.
